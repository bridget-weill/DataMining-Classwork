    "Machine learning is a branch in computer science that studies the design of algorithms that can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical tasks are concept learning, function learning or “predictive modeling”, clustering and finding predictive patterns. These tasks are learned through available data that were observed through experiences or instructions, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hope that comes with this discipline is that including the experience into its tasks will eventually improve the learning. But this improvement needs to happen in such a way that the learning itself becomes automatic so that humans like ourselves don’t need to interfere anymore is the ultimate goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s scikit-learn tutorial will introduce you to the basics of Python machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1: You'll learn how to use Python and its libraries to explore your data with the help of matplotlib and Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\n",
    "- Part 2a: And you'll preprocess your data with normalization and you'll split your data into training and test sets.\n",
    "- Part 2b: Next, you'll work with the well-known KMeans algorithm to construct an unsupervised model, fit this model to your data, predict values, and validate the model that you have built.\n",
    "- Part 3: As an extra, you'll also see how you can also use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to construct another model to classify your data.\n",
